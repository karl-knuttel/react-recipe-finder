This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A super simple React app that pulls data from an API (using basic ol' fetch), in this case recipes from [Food2Fork.com](http://www.food2fork.com).
You can search for recipes by keyword and the app will display the first 10 results. Click on the 'view recipe' button to... yep, you guessed it, view the recipe (well, just a link to the site the recipe originated on, but you get the picture)!

## Usage

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
